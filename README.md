##Description:

CodersClan Clone is a custom one-page WordPress theme which I developed as part of a challenge to get accepted in CodersClan as a WordPress developer. It was built upon [underscores](https://github.com/Automattic/_s) starter WordPress theme. Here is a brief documentation for this theme.

##CodersClan Clone Documentaiton:

1. All of the content of the page is dynamic and can be altered from WordPress admin.
2. Logo Image, Footer Text and Social Icons can be changed from the Theme Options menu.
3. Footer Navigation can be updated from the WordPress Menu Section.
4. Testimonials can be added through a post type named Testimonials which I created.

6. Contact Form information is saved in the WordPress as per requirement and can be seen in Flamingo menu.
7. All other content can be changed and updated from the Edit Page option in the pages menu.
