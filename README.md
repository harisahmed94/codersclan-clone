All of the content of the page is dynamic and can be altered from WordPress admin.
Logo Image, Footer Text and Social Icons can be changed from the Theme Options menu.

Testimonials can be added through a post type named Testimonials which I created.
Contact Form can be edited and customized according to requirements using Contact Form 7 plugin which I integrated with the theme.
Contact Form information is saved in the WordPress as per requirement and can be seen in Flamingo menu.

The site is responsive and I have used 12 column layout of Twitter Bootstrap for responsiveness as per design requirements.
